🧠 Parkinson’s Disease Detection Using Online Handwriting Analysis

This project presents an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for detecting Parkinson’s Disease (PD) using online handwriting dynamics.
The system combines kinematic feature extraction, Beta-Elliptical stroke modeling, fuzzy perceptual features, and a Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) deep learning model to classify subjects as Parkinson’s affected or Healthy.
